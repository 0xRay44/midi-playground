# midi playground

bouncing square video, FOSS edition (and gamified)

## how to run

download python from [here](https://python.org) specifically (3.9.1 should work)

install requirements with `python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt`

start program with `python3 main.py`

there is no more cli tool, but there is a gui

## credits

wikipedia.mid from wikipedia (credit to dogman15)

bad-piggies.mid from [here](https://www.vgmusic.com/new-files/Bad_Piggies_MIDIPIANO.mid)

thanks to gershen for making the classical vip midi

cant remember where i got the others from (sorry if i stole midi file)

mainmenu.mp3 song is Aerial City by Chika for tetr.io (will replace later, but this is fine for now i think)

if you do not enjoy me using your midi or songs, i can remove it from this project and replace them

## todo

### generic

- see entire map at the end
- themes (dark mode, light mode, rainbow, chaos, neon, idk)
- add scoring and make it good
- implement modifiers like osu (DT, HR, HD, EZ, etc)
- midi text events at specific timestamps to change the speed of the cube
- more songs
- map editor if time
- add monitor framerate finder for linux (not macos b/c i hate mac users) [link here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1225057/how-can-i-determine-the-monitor-refresh-rate)

### modifiers

- light switch that turns on and off at each bounce ? (flashlight)
- precise mode (~0.04 or less room for error else a miss)
- theatre mode (no scoring)
