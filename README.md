# midi playground

the bouncing square videos, but open source

inspiration from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QhUcpGKzumo and Project JDM

almost all samples from [bitmidi.com](https://bitmidi.com/)

wikipedia.mid from wikipedia (credit to dogman15)

bad-piggies.mid from [here](https://www.vgmusic.com/new-files/Bad_Piggies_MIDIPIANO.mid)

thanks to gershen for making the classical vip midi

cant remember where i got the others from (sorry if i stole midi file)

mainmenu.mp3 song is Aerial City by Chika for tetr.io (will replace later, but this is fine for now i think)

if you do not enjoy me using your midi or songs, i can remove it from this project and replace them

## how to run

example: `python3 cli.py ./songs/cruel-angels-thesis-mainlines.mid -m ./songs/cruel-angels-thesis.mid`

for instructions on CLI tool, use `python3 main.py -h`

there are different CLI flags that you can use, like `-c` for camera mode

## todo

- see entire map at the end
- themes (dark mode, light mode, rainbow, chaos, neon, etc)
- make it a playable game
- midi text events at specific timestamps to change the speed of the cube
- light switch that turns on and off at each bounce ? idk would be cool
- more songs
- add monitor framerate finder for linux (not macos b/c i hate mac users) [link here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1225057/how-can-i-determine-the-monitor-refresh-rate)
