## how to run

download python from [here](https://python.org) specifically (3.9.1 should work)

thanks to gershen for making the classical vip midi

cant remember where i got the others from (sorry if i stole midi file)

mainmenu.mp3 song is Aerial City by Chika for tetr.io (will replace later, but this is fine for now i think)

if you do not enjoy me using your midi or songs, i can remove it from this project and replace them

## todo

### generic

- redo scoring because it currently sucks
- add a timer in the beginning so you can predict first note
- visual aid for timing
- life bar
- see entire map at the end
- themes (dark mode, light mode, rainbow, chaos, neon, idk)
- make scoring good
- implement modifiers like osu (DT, HR, HD, EZ, etc)
- midi text events at specific timestamps to change the speed of the cube
- more songs
- map editor if time
- add monitor framerate finder for linux (not macos b/c i hate mac users) [link here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1225057/how-can-i-determine-the-monitor-refresh-rate)
- i think there are sync issues idk

### modifiers

- light switch that turns on and off at each bounce ? (flashlight)
- precise mode (no 100s, only 300s or misses)
- theatre mode (no scoring)
